##  Features

- Multi-label text classification using a trained Logistic Regression model
- TF-IDF based text vectorization
- Label binarization using MultiLabelBinarizer
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) using a custom `extract_combined_entities` function
- Fast and scalable REST API using **FastAPI**
- Clean and structured responses in JSON
